# Deploying and Managing with Kubernetes

Now that the CI/CD pipeline has been setup and the microservices are packaged into Docker containers, the challenge lies in deploying, scaling, and managing these containers effectively. Kubernetes, a powerful container orchestration platform, is used to meet this challenge. I'll discuss how I used Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment of containerized microservices on AWS.

## **Understanding Kubernetes**

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. It's designed to automate, scale, and manage containerized applications.

- **Scaling**: Automatically scale the number of containers based on traffic.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming application traffic across multiple containers.
- **Self-healing**: Restart failed containers or replace containers when nodes die.
- **Rollouts & Rollbacks**: Manage application updates seamlessly, with the ability to roll back if needed.

## **Deploying on AWS EKS**

AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) provides a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easier to run and orchestrate containers on AWS. Here's how I integrated it:

### **Setting Up EKS Cluster**

The EKS cluster, provisioned earlier using Terraform, serves as the primary Kubernetes environment. It interacts with worker nodes where the containers are scheduled.

### **Kubernetes Configurations**

Using `kubectl`, the command-line tool for Kubernetes, I applied various configurations:

- **Namespaces**: For separating different environments like staging and production.
- **Deployments**: For deploying microservices, specifying the desired number of replicas and the Docker image to use.
- **Services**: To expose the microservices internally or externally, acting as a load balancer.
- **Ingress**: For routing external traffic to the appropriate services based on URLs or paths.
- **ConfigMaps & Secrets**: For managing configuration data and sensitive information separately from container images.

## **Helm: The Kubernetes Package Manager**

Helm simplifies deploying and managing Kubernetes applications. By using Helm charts, pre-configured Kubernetes resources can be packaged and shared.

For each microservice, I created a Helm chart. This chart encapsulates all the Kubernetes resources (like deployments, services, and ingress) required for that microservice, making deployments consistent and repeatable.

### **Deploying with Helm**

Within the Jenkins pipeline, once the Docker images are pushed to ECR, Helm is used to deploy or upgrade the microservices on the EKS cluster.

## **Monitoring and Logging**

To ensure the smooth running of applications:

- **Prometheus & Grafana**: I integrated Prometheus for monitoring metrics and Grafana for visualization.
- **EFK Stack**: Employed the Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack for logging, ensuring easy access and analysis of logs.

## **Conclusion**

With Kubernetes and its ecosystem of tools, I've effectively orchestrated the deployment and management of our microservices-based application on AWS. This setup ensures high availability, scalability, and resilience.
