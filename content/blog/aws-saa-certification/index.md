# Introduction
I passed SAA-C03 - AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification exam.

# Certification Information
As Cloud Computing continues to ascend, businesses are in a constant state of transition, moving away from traditional on-premise infrastructure towards the cloud. This migration brings a wealth of advantages, primarily in terms of scalability and resilience when confronted with unexpected disasters.

The AWS **Solutions Architect - Associate** certification stands as a testament to your proficiency in crafting and deploying meticulously planned solutions within the AWS ecosystem, currently the foremost cloud provider in the industry. In essence, this examination gauges your aptitude for conceiving architectural designs tailored to specific scenarios. To illustrate, consider a scenario where a company desires the uninterrupted operation of its application, even in the face of a catastrophic event causing an entire AWS region to become inoperable. In this context, how would you strategically structure their infrastructure to meet this exigent requirement?
