# Front-End Development in the Cloud Resume Project

In this phase of my **Cloud Resume Project**, I ventured into building the front-end of my project, mastering various tools and techniques to create a polished web presence.

## Crafting a Resume in HTML

My journey began with creating a digital resume. I opted for the simplicity and precision of **HTML** to structure my content exactly as desired, laying the foundation for future styling.

## Styling with CSS

To elevate my resume's visual appeal, I harnessed the power of **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**. CSS enabled me to transform plain HTML content into an aesthetically pleasing document, effectively showcasing my skills and experience.

## Hosting with S3, HTTPS, and DNS

With my resume ready, the next step was making it globally accessible. I hosted it as a static website on **Amazon S3**, ensuring secure delivery over **HTTPS** using **Amazon CloudFront** and configuring DNS for seamless access.

## Configuring Route 53 and Routing Policies

To guarantee uninterrupted website access, I leveraged **Amazon Route 53**. This involved configuring routing policies and creating essential DNS records.

## Addressing Name Server Issues

Managing name servers posed a challenge. I configured my domain with the correct name servers of the hosted zone to ensure precise domain resolution.

## Enhanced Hosting with CloudFront

For heightened website performance and security, I implemented **Amazon CloudFront**. This content delivery network (CDN) acted as an intermediary, facilitating faster load times and enhanced security.

## SSL Certificate from ACM

Security was paramount, so I fortified my website with an **SSL certificate** courtesy of **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**. This crucial step provided encryption and instilled trustworthiness, enhancing visitor safety.

## Designing with Hugo

To infuse a professional and polished aesthetic into my website, I turned to **Hugo**. This static site generator empowered me to craft a visually appealing and responsive website with ease.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions for Deployment

Efficient deployment was achieved through **GitHub** and **GitHub Actions**, streamlining the process and enabling automation. I did encounter image display challenges during this phase.

## Overcoming Image Display Challenges

To address image display issues, I implemented solutions like **PaperMod** and fine-tuned content and static paths on my Hugo HTML website. These adjustments ensured images were displayed correctly, enhancing the overall user experience.
