Hello! Nice to meet you.

These days, Iâ€™m working with different cloud technologies and integrations such as AWS, Azure, containers, CI/CD and using infra-as-code tools such as Terraform.

One of my passions is Systems Engineering. I enjoy finding the best way to improve the reliability and scalability of various technologies, as well as streamlining the process of pushing code into production.

I have a keen interest in the field of Automation and applying it into the work I produce. Creating high quality and reusuable code through scripts written in various languages is something that I strive to achieve.

I have over 6 years of System Engineering experience in the public sector working for the City of New York as a Systems Administrator. I am looking to advance my career and skillset into the cloud. I want to incorporate my existing skills and knowledge to provide positive growth to the companies I work with, as well as my own personal growth.

In my spare time, I enjoy working out and working on game development. Working out helps me to relieve the stress of the day and clears my mind, allowing me to focus. Game Developoment is a fun way for me to advance my programming skills.

Thanks for reading!
