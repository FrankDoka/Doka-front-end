My name is Frank Doka. I am currently located in New York City.

These days, Iâ€™m working with different cloud technologies and integrations such as AWS, containers, CI/CD and using infra-as-code tools such as Terraform.

One of my passions is Systems Engineering. Finding the best way to improve reliability and scalability of various technologies. Streamlining the process of pushing code into production.

I have a keen interest in the field of Automation and applying it into the work I produce. Creating high quality and re-usuable code through scripts written in various languages is something that I strive to achieve.

I have over 6 years of system engineering experience in the public sector working for the City of New York as a Systems Administrator. I am looking to advance my career and skillset into the cloud and incorporate my existing skills and knowledge to provide positive growth to the companies I work with as well as my own personal growth.
